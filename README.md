# Welcome
This project is a part of multiple similar projects that visualize the process of how algorithms sort data, this one would be showing how quicksort would organize a set of data. 
It was made with sdl2, a c++ library which let me open up a window and visualize the whole process to the screen.

This project visualizes the QuickSort algorithm in real time, showing how data is recursively partitioned and sorted. Built in C++ with the SDL2 library, it provides a step-by-step graphical demonstration aimed at making sorting algorithms easier to understand for students and developers.
