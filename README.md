# Welcome
An interactive real-time visualization of the QuickSort algorithm built with C++ and SDL2. Watch as data gets recursively partitioned and sorted with smooth animations and color-coded elements to understand one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

## About 

This project is part of a series of algorithm visualization tools designed to help students and developers understand sorting algorithms through visual representation. QuickSort, known for its exceptional average-case performance, uses a divide-and-conquer strategy that becomes crystal clear when visualized in real-time.

## Features

- 🚀Real-time QuickSort visualization with smooth animation</li>
- 🌈Color-coded elements to distinguish pivot, partitions, and sorted sections</li>
- 🎬Adjustable animation speed for detailed analysis or quick overview</li>
- 📊Multiple data set sizes to observe algorithm behavior at different scales</li>
- 🔎Step-by-step breakdown showing pivot selection and partitioning process</li>
- 🔗Performance metrics display including comparisons and swaps counter</li>
- ⚡Interactive controls for pause, reset, and speed adjustment</li>

## Algotithm Breakdown

The visualization demonstrates the key phases of QuickSort:
1. 🎯 Pivot Selection - Choose an element as the pivot (highlighted in red)
2. 🔄 Partitioning - Rearrange elements so smaller values are on the left, larger on the right (highlighted in orange)
3. 📌 Pivot Placement - Position the pivot in its final sorted location (highlighted in green)
4. 🔁 Recursive Division - Repeat the process on left and right subarrays (highlighted in blue)
5. ✅ Sorted Elements - Elements in their final position (highlighted in white)

## Time Complexity
- Best Case **O(n log n)**
- Average Case **O(n log n)**
- Worst Case **O(n²)**


## Prerequisites

- **C++ compiler** (C++11 or later)
- **SDL2 development libraries**
- **CMake** (optional, for building)
